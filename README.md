# Best Docker Container in Swift

```
Several years have passed since Swift was released as open source and Linux became supported. The adoption of server side Swift has increased. Meanwhile, Swift is constantly being updated, and the cost of supporting different Swift versions on multiple machines is getting higher.

By using Docker, this cost can be reduced by preparing a virtual environment container with a fixed Swift version, so we can develop without relying on version. Also, since Docker does not perform full virtualization, disk usage is small, and virtual environment initialization and startup are fast.

In this talk, I'll explore the best Docker container for Swift.
